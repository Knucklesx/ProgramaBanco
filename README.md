## Bank program in Java


The program's idea is create a program which should help the worker to add a new client to bank database. 
It'll ask the worker the client name, the account number, if there's an initial deposit, if there's no initial deposit, the account balance should be $ 0.0.
After that, the program will ask about deposit and withdrawn. In both cases, the program should update the data and show the new updated data to the bank worker. If the client wish to withdrawn some money, there'll be charged $5.00. It's possible that the account balance remain zero or negative after the charges.
